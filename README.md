Emotion Detection using Python and OpenCV
Overview
This project implements an emotion detection system using Python and OpenCV. Emotion detection is achieved by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of facial expressions to recognize various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.
Features
Data Collection and Preparation: The dataset consists of facial expression images labeled with emotions.
Model Training: A CNN model is trained on the dataset using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.
Real-time Emotion Detection: Once trained, the model can detect emotions in real-time through a webcam feed or static images.

Requirements
